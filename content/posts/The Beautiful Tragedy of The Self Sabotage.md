# The Disquiet

In the past few weeks, I have encountered two separate incidents which have made me uncomfortable to the point that I am awake during the night pondering about the “Self” and particularly the “destruction of the Self”. Like many, I have also built sand castles on the seashore, only to see them wash away. There is some contentment in seeing the castle, built with so much effort, wash away into the relentless ocean. It gives a sense of liberation. That’s why we love tragedies. The romantic sense of loss and the gentle heartaches, like bittersweet, give depth to this superficial world. The sigh of breathing out releases futile hopes from our minds and honors the truth that always prevailed.

# On Self-Sabotage

We go through enormous trouble to build ourselves. Then a phase of self-sabotage arrives and starts eroding everything. It would be manageable at first, but it rises exponentially, wiping out years of relentless work. This behavior of self-destruction entombs the promises of the future in the “could have” and “would have been” possibilities. I have seen this many times. Sometimes, I wonder, **why are people so relentless in destroying themselves?**

# Narcissism & Paranoia: The First Incident

The first incident involved a popular YouTuber who built his career on self-help, motivation, and pop philosophy. He set up a team. Then, for many years, obsessively contenting and collaborating to amass a sizable following. In the beginning, he catered to serious content. His noble intentions were later watered down as he added more drama and pop content to his channel to cater to the larger population and content demands. Indulging in reactions and controversies, he often prioritized and catered to the audience’s demands over his intentions.

Lately, in one freak incident, he managed to sabotage his image, which would have a lasting impact on the years of work he and his group have put in. There are many pious and penitent YouTubers when their masks fall off, the reality is often dark and ugly. His desire for followers and success clashed with his desire to make a lasting social impact. The cognitive dissonance paved the way for paranoia and narcissism. Sometimes it’s hard to differentiate between narcissism and paranoia. Either narcissism or paranoia or both has set in & this wave of self-sabotage now jeopardizes the purpose he once promised.

# The Depths of Tragic Infatuation: The Second Incident

The second incident is too bizarre and depressing. One YouTuber who delivered lectures on self-realization had fallen into the dark pit of infatuation and alcoholism. His goal was to raise the awareness of the people by raising their spiritual quotient. He has now lost all of his sensibility and awareness. He is now obsessing over a teenage celebrity, infatuated to the extent that he cannot rationalize anything anymore. Not only that, but he has deluded himself to the extent that he thinks everything around him points to the fact that he should be with her. From the matchbox cover to the songs that he hears, he sees everything as a coincidence, pointing him to her.

Nothing is more colossally depressing than seeing an aspiring seeker fall into the dark recesses of a mental health crisis. He is now promising self-harm over the rejection of this girl. Reeling from loneliness and unfulfilled desire, he has not been able to accept his current state.

He liked to sing, but couldn’t become a singer. He wanted to be famous and loved, but his life didn’t turn out to be like that. He wanted a good childhood, but didn’t have it. The teenage celebrity has everything he ever wanted to be. **She is his desire personified.** He had met her once. He keeps her picture. He has lost everything, and he has invested everything in her. He has slipped into the total delusion that he could be one with her. He thought that by marrying her, he could somehow gain back everything that he had lost. It reminds me of the Great Gatsby and his pursuit of the past. Now, he is destroying himself with alcohol and drugs. He has run out of his savings. He is begging for money from people online. His state is beyond sad. He “live streams” this ordeal for people to see and comment on. It is disturbing.

# The Honesty of a Tragedy

**The beauty of a tragedy is its honesty.** People lie about themselves to others. People lie to themselves. But a tragedy cleanses all lies. The wave of truth destroys false castles made in the sand to appease themselves and the crowd. The tragedy is relentless. The destruction humbles us. It aches our hearts and grounds us. **Self-sabotage happens because the inner conscience cannot be lied to.** **It is the great “Unknown Known”.** Every lie builds pressure and one day, bursting at the seams, it engulfs and takes over the mind.

I don’t know what will happen now. If they survive this, it will change them forever. **Self-sabotage is an act of eliminating the contradiction between the heart and the mind. No matter what the cost is, it will happen. Inner witnesses know of no external costs.** Others will point a finger at them and throw stones at them. But the ambition of human beings to be something more is remarkable. The human conscience is remarkable. So is its effect on human beings. As I ponder, I can only wonder at the beautiful tragedy of the destruction of the self.
